# STPManager (System Test Plan Manager)
My team and I implemented an innovative system designed to streamline the management of test plans and test cases, facilitating a more efficient testing process. This project focuses on optimizing test organization and execution through a sophisticated structure divided into four main subpackages: manager, test_plan, test_case, io, and ui.
